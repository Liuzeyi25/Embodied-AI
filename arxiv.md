> propose a framework that leverages LLMs to select appropriate planning and control strategies based on task descriptions, environmental constraints, and system dynamics. These strategies are then executed by calling the available comprehensive planning and control APIs. Our approach employs iterative LLM-based reasoning with performance feedback to refine the algorithm selection
